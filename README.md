# Predict optimal control
In this case,there are two different banch, one is the design of predictor, the other one is the method of optimal control. I provide two kinds of predictor, The deterministic predictor and the stochastic predictor. The deterministic predictor is based on the lstm and horizon rolling lstm. The dataset I have used is the open source dataset,NGSIM, After processing this dataset, it divide to 2442 dataset. It represent 2442 different cars recorded by the camera and laser. I only upload 250 dataset cause processing this dataset is a hard work. It can't be got in a easy way.
